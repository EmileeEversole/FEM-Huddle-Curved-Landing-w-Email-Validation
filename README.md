## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS (including CSS Grid)
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

For this project, I decided to try to work on a tablet version as well, even though there isn't a design for one. It wasn't too bad, because I essentially used a mix of the mobile and desktop layout that I had already created. I also made sure that the email validation in the newsletter section worked properly, even though it wasn't part of the challenge. I've done email validation on multiple projects, so I feel a little more confident working with it now!


### Continued development

I find it pretty tedious to try to go back and forth and find elements when I'm trying to build a responsive layout, especially when I'm doing something like designing the desktop version and I have to keep going back to look at the mobile version to remember what I had. It's definitely time that I start looking into frameworks to try to cut down on some of this work, or at least find a better method.

## Acknowledgments

I just wanted to say that I'm so thankful to my awesome husband, Caleb, for always being so supportive. His birthday is next week, and I'm hoping to have a pretty cool project to give him as a birthday present. It's something I've never worked with before, so it's going to be quite the challenge. Fingers crossed!
